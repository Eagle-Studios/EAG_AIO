//Vehicle Request Description

This Vehicle Request script allows editors to set predefined vehicles to be spawned at a marker location. 
This is useful for reducing FPS when many vehicle types may not be needed at all times ingame. 
This allows players to request vehicles without Zeus interaction. 

This script primarily uses 3CB (British Army) Vehicles, however RHS was used in the creation of this script. 

//This File

This READ ME! file is located inside the Main Directory. 

Inside the INFO folder 3 SQF files are present (Though these are not SQF files to be used in-game)

There is a 3rd Party addon for Notepad++ that adds SQF's and makes them Arma friendly; (https://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=8680)
these files are formatted as SQF's for this ease of access. 

//veh_req #Laptop Init AddAction Full#
This is the full Init text that goes into the Init on the object you are having players interact with. 
Personally I use a Rugged Laptop with a custom texture on the screen. 
Simply copy and paste this text into the Init box of your chosen object.

//veh_req #AddAction with Classnames#
This is a full directory of all the "this addAction" init text. 
It includes the classnames for easy reference. 

//veh_req #_veh = classname - create @ marker#

This is a full directory of all vehicle classnames being called for when the individual files are requested via the Laptop. 
You can find all the individual request files in the Main Directory (Example: veh_req_quad (This spawns vanilla Quad Bike)
It includes the classnames for easy reference.
